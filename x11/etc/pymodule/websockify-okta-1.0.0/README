This is a minimal module providing a Token Plugin for Websockify that,
 given an access token passed in via the URL (?token query parameter),
verifies that the token is active, and that the user is the same as the
user specified by ID in the source variable.
To use:
websockify ... --token-plugin websockify_okta.OktaVerifyUserAccessToken --token-source 127.0.0.1:5900

This is meant to be used by passing USER_ID as an env var at container run-time.
